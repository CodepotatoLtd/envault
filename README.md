## Installation

The Envault server is built on [the Laravel PHP framework](https://laravel.com). This makes installation very simple. It requires a minimum PHP version of 7.4.

1) Clone this repository onto your server.

2) Copy .env.example to .env. Generate a new `APP_KEY` using `php artisan key:generate`. Make sure that your `APP_URL` matches the address of your Envault server.

3) Create a new database. For more details on the databases supported, please refer to [the Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/database#introduction). Fill out any connection details in your `.env` file, then run `php artisan migrate`.
