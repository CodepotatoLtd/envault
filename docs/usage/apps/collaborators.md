# Managing an app's collaborators

App collaborators are [users](https://github.com/envault/envault/blob/master/docs/usage/users/permissions.md) that have access to an app. To add one, select the user from the dropdown list and click "add".

By default, collaborators can view your variables and sync them locally. To allow a collaborator to update variables as well, click "Collaborator" under their name and confirm the promotion.
