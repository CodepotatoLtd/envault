# Managing Slack notifications

Developers in your team can be notified through Slack when variables are updated on a project they’re working on.

This behaviour can be set up by uploading your [Slack Webhook URL](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) and channel name to your app’s settings. Save, and you should now be ready to receive notifications.

Envault will confirm a successful setup by sending a message to the channel you set up in.
