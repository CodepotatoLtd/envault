# Managing a user's permissions

You can manage a user’s permissions by changing their “role”.

Envault provides you with three user roles to choose from:

- Owners have no restrictions and can manage anything on your server.
- Admins can manage every app on your server, and can create new users.
- Users can’t access any apps by default, instead being [added as a “collaborator” to their apps](https://github.com/envault/envault/blob/master/docs/usage/apps/collaborators.md).

To change a user’s role, go to the “users” tab in Envault and click on the user you would like to update, then “edit”. You can now select a new role for the user and save it.
