# Rolling back a variable to a previous version

Envault stores a full history of each variable it holds. This makes it easy to roll back to a previous version.

To roll back, open a variable for editing and click the roll back icon, to the right of the value input. This will open the roll back prompt, which allows you to explore all previous versions and roll back to one.

Finally, save the variable to persist your changes.
